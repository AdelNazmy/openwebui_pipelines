       "This is an excellent and comprehensive test data generation! You've successfully created a robust set of test cases covering a wide range of scenarios. The table is well-organized, clearly labeled, and includes all the necessary elements for automated testing.  Here's a breakdown of what's particularly strong and some minor suggestions for further enhancement:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Strengths:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** You've addressed positive and negative scenarios, including input validation, edge cases, and system errors. The inclusion of multiple device purchase scenarios is particularly valuable.\n",
       "*   **Realistic Data:** The use of specific device models (iPhone 17) and data values (500GB) adds realism to the test data.\n",
       "*   **Clear Test Steps:** The test steps are concise and actionable, making it easy for testers to execute the tests.\n",
       "*   **Well-Defined Expected Results:** The expected results are clearly stated, allowing for straightforward verification.\n",
       "*   **Prioritization:**  Including a priority column is crucial for efficient test execution.\n",
       "*   **Summary Table:** The summary table provides a quick overview of the test coverage.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Suggestions for Enhancement:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Data Variety:** While the data values are realistic, consider expanding the range of values, especially for data usage.  Instead of just 500GB, include:\n",
       "    *   Small Usage: 10GB, 50GB\n",
       "    *   Medium Usage: 100GB, 200GB\n",
       "    *   Large Usage: 500GB, 1TB\n",
       "    *   Extreme Usage: 2TB (to test limits)\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **TAC Codes:** Generate a wider variety of TAC codes.  Don't just use invalid lengths. Include:\n",
       "    *   Valid TAC Codes: (Generate a set of valid codes – e.g., ABC123XYZ)\n",
       "    *   Invalid Characters: TAC codes with special characters (e.g., TAC123!@#)\n",
       "    *   Short TAC Codes: (e.g., ABC1)\n",
       "    *   Long TAC Codes: (e.g., ABC123456789012345)\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Error Message Verification:**  For negative test cases, explicitly define the expected error messages.  For example:\n",
       "    *   \"Invalid Email Format. Please enter a valid email address.\"\n",
       "    *   \"TAC Code Length Must Be 6 Characters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **System Log Details:**  For TC-AUTH-14 (System Error), consider adding a more detailed description of the expected system log entries.  This would help with debugging.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Mapping Table Data:**  Expand on the mapping table configuration tests (TC-AUTH-15 & 16).  Specify the data values that should be in the mapping table.  This is critical for verifying the configuration.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Edge Case - First Usage - Timing:**  For TC-AUTH-06, add a specific time window to verify the immediate activation.  (e.g., \"Within 1 minute of the first data usage.\")\n",
       "\n",
       "7.  **Data Usage Tracking:**  For the \"No Usage\" scenario (TC-AUTH-11), consider how the system should track the offer's expiration.  Is there a specific timer?\n",
       "\n",
       "8.  **Negative - System - No Response:**  Add a test case where the system simply doesn't respond to a request.  This could be due to a network issue or a server outage.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Revised Priority Suggestions (Based on Enhanced Data):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **High:** TC-AUTH-01, TC-AUTH-02, TC-AUTH-06, TC-AUTH-09, TC-AUTH-10, TC-AUTH-12, TC-AUTH-13\n",
       "*   **Medium:** TC-AUTH-04, TC-AUTH-05, TC-AUTH-07, TC-AUTH-08, TC-AUTH-10, TC-AUTH-11, TC-AUTH-15, TC-AUTH-16\n",
       "*   **Low:** TC-AUTH-14, TC-AUTH-17 (New - System - No Response)\n",
       "\n",
       "By incorporating these suggestions, you'll create an even more robust and comprehensive test data set, significantly increasing the confidence in the quality of the solution.  Excellent work!\n",

       "Okay, here’s a comprehensive analysis of the provided context concerning “Etisalat Arena,” incorporating all relevant details and synthesizing information for a thorough understanding.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Understanding the Context: Etisalat Arena – A Focus on Game Subscriptions & IT Integrations**\n",
       "\n",
       "The primary focus of this document is the integration of Arena Esports (likely a competitive gaming platform) with Etisalat, a major telecommunications provider in the region. It’s not simply about “Etisalat Arena” as a physical location, but rather a strategic project to enable Etisalat customers to subscribe to and participate in the Arena Esports platform.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Components & Details:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Project Scope: Game Subscriptions via EPG:**\n",
       "    *   The core activity is facilitating the subscription of games within the Arena Esports platform *through* the Electronic Game Promotion (EPG) system. This suggests a system where users can purchase game access or services related to the platform via Etisalat’s channels.\n",
       "    *   The document highlights the need for discussions with Security Teams regarding the integration, indicating potential security considerations related to user accounts and data.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Etisalat’s Role & Integration Requirements:**\n",
       "    *   **Vendor App Publishing:** A critical aspect is the potential for Etisalat to host or manage vendor applications (likely related to the Arena Esports platform) under Etisalat accounts. This implies a technical integration where the Arena Esports platform’s applications are hosted and managed through Etisalat’s infrastructure.\n",
       "    *   **IT System Updates:** The document outlines specific IT system updates required, including:\n",
       "        *   **BR01:** “To be discussed with Security Teams No CIT Impacts” – This indicates a requirement for security reviews and approvals before any integration can proceed. “CIT Impacts” likely refers to “Change Impact Tracking,” a process for assessing the potential effects of changes.\n",
       "        *   **BR02:** “Product Owner to check with Digital Product Owners on Vendor App publishing under Etisalat account No CIT Impacts” – This specifies a workflow for managing vendor applications, requiring coordination between product owners and digital product owners.\n",
       "        *   **BR03:** “To remove Swarmio integration IP addresses from the IT systems for Arena eSports No CIT Impacts” – This is a technical requirement, suggesting that Swarmio (likely a monitoring and observability tool) is being integrated, and its IP addresses need to be removed from Arena Esports’ IT systems to maintain security and compliance.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **System Involvement:**\n",
       "    *   **B2C & EPG:** The project is centered around the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) channel and the EPG system. This suggests a consumer-facing application or service.\n",
       "    *   **Digital Product Owners:** The involvement of Digital Product Owners highlights the complexity of the integration, requiring expertise in digital product management.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Dependencies & Risks:**\n",
       "    *   **New Vendor Connectivity:** The availability of new vendor connectivity is a critical dependency. This means that the infrastructure and network connections need to be in place to support the integration.\n",
       "    *   **Security Considerations:** The repeated emphasis on security (Security Teams, CIT Impacts, Swarmio IP addresses) underscores the importance of robust security measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Relationships & Connections:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The EPG system is the *enabler* – it’s the mechanism through which users subscribe to Arena Esports games.\n",
       "*   Etisalat’s infrastructure provides the *platform* for this subscription process.\n",
       "*   The integration requires close collaboration between Etisalat’s various teams (Product Owners, Digital Product Owners, Security Teams) and Arena Esports.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Missing Information & Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Specific Game Titles:** The document doesn’t detail which games are being offered through the Arena Esports platform.\n",
       "*   **Technical Specifications:** There are no technical specifications provided regarding the EPG system, the Arena Esports platform, or the integration architecture.\n",
       "*   **User Interface/Experience:** There’s no information about the user interface or the overall customer experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary, “Etisalat Arena” in this context represents a strategic partnership to bring competitive gaming to Etisalat customers through a subscription-based service, requiring significant technical and operational integration.**\n",

    "\n",
    "The Knowledge Base tab functionality includes two main workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upload Knowledge Base Documents**:\n",
    "   - User uploads a ZIP file containing documents (BRDs, SDDs, Excel files with test cases)\n",
    "   - Backend extracts the ZIP file via `/kb/upload-zip` endpoint\n",
    "   - Documents are processed through the knowledge base pipeline\n",
    "   - BRD/SDD documents are processed with DoclingReader for PDF, DOCX, and other formats\n",
    "   - Excel files are parsed specifically for UAT test scenarios\n",
    "   - UAT test scenarios are stored separately in MongoDB with reference IDs\n",
    "   - Content is stored in a vector index (Qdrant or Simple) for semantic search\n",
    "   - Vector embeddings are generated using configured embedding models\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Knowledge Base**:\n",
    "   - User enters a query in the text field\n",
    "   - Query is sent to the backend `/kb/generate` endpoint\n",
    "   - Backend loads the knowledge base index\n",
    "   - Vector index is queried for relevant documents\n",
    "   - System checks if query contains 'test case' keyword:\n",
    "     - If 'test case' is detected: UAT test scenarios are retrieved from MongoDB using stored reference IDs\n",
    "     - If 'test case' is not detected: Context is retrieved based on semantic similarity\n",
    "   - Response is generated using the LLM based on the appropriate retrieved information\n",
    "   - Results are displayed in the UI with proper formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge base uses LlamaIndex, Qdrant vector store, MongoDB, and Docling for document processing to store and retrieve relevant information for generating test cases."
